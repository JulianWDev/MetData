When considering data sources available on water quality and traffic in Amsterdam it's hard to find holistic and detailed data sets online. However, for this assignment we have considered a combination potential data sets available and other sources for information which might create a complete image or at least a starting point for more specific measurement in water quality later.

When consider the need to not interfere with water transport we havenâ€™t found easily accessible raw data however we have found a pdf map which shows no go zones in pink [(here)](https://sloepdelen.nl/downloads/information_amsterdam_en.pdf). Furthermore, to track main traffic routes throughout this website which track the pathways of ships in the world and also Amsterdam can create an idea of what areas are frequently frequented (https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/centerx:4.910/centery:52.375/zoom:13 ). Through a scraper tool one could also over time derive all of the data through time which would allow a more detail consideration for the event managers to consider. However, neither of these data sources are directly usable in python in their current format.
