    "Last week we installed Pandas and this week we will have another Panda installed, this time the Geopandas library. In fact we/you are going to install quite a few libraries. I lost track of them so when executing the examples you might get an error about a missing library. Most if not all the time you can do a *pip install missing_library* on the command line, then restart the kernel of your current Jupyter notebook and continue. The restart option is located above under the menu Kernel.\n",

    "When doing any scientific computing with Python, there is a 99.999% chance you are going to use [Numpy](https://numpy.org/). Numpy is often imported with the abbreviation np. The same with Pandas, it is imported as pd. For analysing networks there is a library called [Networkx](https://networkx.org/), imported as nx. After a while you start noticing these abbreviations in the names of methods or functions of other libraries. Then you sort of know what library is used and what datatype or object you will need to input or that will be returned to you. Apart from Numpy, another library that is almost always used under the hood is [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). A lot of other \"plotters\" are wrapped around functionality provided by Matplotlib.\n",

The nodes need to be of a hashable type, a type that can't be changed (like a string or a number). Edges can hold any kind of data.\n",

    "OSM is build up of nodes with data attached including geometric data. But it is all in numbers and it is very hard to remember that your address is at node 22345339. It is also annoying looking up a node id on the website of OSM. OSM uses the Nominatim api to convert addresses to a coordinate (latitude, longitude). OSMNX has a method to do this using Python. Another Python library is Geocoder used by programs like QGIS and ArcGIS."

    "With the [OSMNX distance](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-reference.html#module-osmnx.distance) module you can find the shortest path between two nodes. The *shortest_path* function needs a Graph, and a start and end point. By default it uses the attribute *length* to calcualte the distances between nodes. This attribute is added automatically when reading in data using one of the *graph_** functions. In case you are missing the attribute, your data is coming from somewhere else, you can use the *add_edge_length* function."
